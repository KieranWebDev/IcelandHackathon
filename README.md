# This is a fork of the Iceland Hackathon Challenge

I created this fork to improve the hackathon challenge's functionality and code a little bit. I created components for the buttons, Banner and Produce List section. I added the slice method so that only the first 10 items in the produce list are shown at any time. I also added some conditional logic to display pictures of vegetables or fruit depending on the product type. I only had an hour or so to implement these changes so the CSS is still a mess as I ran out of time.

### I deployed the site and it can be viewed [here](https://iceland-hackathon.vercel.app/).
